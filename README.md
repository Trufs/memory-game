# Memory Game Project
A simple game of finding matching pairs of cards, written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game can be useful for training memory, concentration and perception skills.

### Prerequisites
The game can be run in any browser which supports ES6 and Flexbox. Internet connection is needed for fonts and symbols.

### Installing
No instalation is needed.

## Instructions
The game table consists of 16 cards with symbols. There is 8 different symbols total, each of them is featured on 2 cards. The aim of the game is finding all the pairs of matching symbols.
After clicking on 'Start' button, click on two cards. If their symbols are matching, the cards will change color and stay open. If the symbols are not the same, they will be hidden after your next click. Now you can open the next two cards.
Try to remember where each symbol is situated so that you can find matching pairs faster.
Once you've found all pairs, you won. A message will be displayed showing number of moves you've  made, time it took you and the star ranking. The ranking depends on the number of moves you've made until finding all the pairs: 3 stars if it took you less than 10 moves, 2 stars if it took you less than 15 moves, 1 star if it took you more. You can also restart the game from this panel.
The game can also be restarted anytime using the restart button on the top right of the game table. Restarting makes the symbols change positions randomly, so you'll have to learn their positions from the beginning. The timer and the number of moves count up from 0 and the stars you've lost are replaced.
